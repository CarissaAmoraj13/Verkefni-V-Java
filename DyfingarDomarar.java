 * LÃ½sing: 
 * The code calculates the final score for an Olympic diving event. It reads execution scores
 * from two swimmers, coordination scores from five judges, and a difficulty level. The program 
 * computes the total execution score by discarding the highest and lowest scores for each swimmer, 
 * calculates the average coordination score by discarding the highest and lowest scores, and 
 * multiplies the sum of these scores by the difficulty level to get the final score. The result is
 * printed with two decimal places.
